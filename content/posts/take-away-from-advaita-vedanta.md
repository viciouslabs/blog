Let's indulge in some philosophy today. **Advaita Vedanta**.

## What is Advaita Vedanta?
Advaita Vedanta is the Indian philosophy of non-duality which states there is only one ultimate reality (Brahman), 
and the changing world is merely a temporary appearance.

It teaches that your individual self (Atman) is identical to this universal reality, much like a wave is distinctive in 
form but identical to the ocean in substance.

Liberation comes from shedding the illusion of separation and realizing you are not the limited body or mind, but that 
infinite, unchanging consciousness.

## Concepts and Definitions

The philosophy is encapsulated in the phrase "Brahma Satyam, Jagan Mithya" (Brahman is the Truth, the World is Illusion),
offers a radical
system upgrade for how we view the world.

- Mithya - Apparent Reality / Illusion
- Satya - Absolute Reality
- Gyaan - Realization of the Truth
- Saakshi Bhaav - Spiritual practice of cultivating a detached, non-judgmental "witness" attitude toward your own 
thoughts, emotions, and the world around you

As a human progresses in life, his knowledge (Gyaan) evolves. What is only a T-Shirt in childhood, is realized to be 
cotton threads in adulthood. As this progression happen, we realize that the object being a T-Shirt is a partial truth or
and illusion, the truth is that it's cotton threads. And then we learn that the physical unit of thread is Trichome, polymer,
monomer and eventually the building block would be glucose. So, apart from the eventual truth (whatever that structural unit
of existence is), everything else is just an illusion (Mithya); it's something that is not untrue, but also not the purest
form of truth.

> Okay, that's it, we won't learn the entire philosophy today. So, we'll use this as the base information.

## Tying this to Software Development

Even a senior software developer who has mastered the syntax of the coding language, drowns in the complexity of transient
frameworks. That's probably because coding language's syntax is Mithya (apparent reality), but not the Satya (Absolute truth).

Let's learn and apply **Advaita** philosophy to a senior dev who wishes to be an architect.

### Mithya: The Trap of "Implementation Details"

Mithya (Apparent Reality) describes things that appear real but change constantly and have no independent
existence (like a pot, which is just a form of clay). Software Parallel: Frameworks and Languages are Mithya.

### Satya: The Unchanging Architecture

Satya is that which remains valid in the past, present, and future (Tri-kala-abadhyam). **Software Parallel: Design 
Patterns and SOLID Principles are Satya**.

- Specific frameworks die every 5 years
- **Architectural Truths persist**. The concept of "Decoupling" or "Publisher-Subscriber" was true in 1970, is true in 2025,
and will be true in 2050.
- **Implementation**: An Architect builds systems based on Satya (stable principles), not Mithya (hype).
  -  Example: A bad architect couples the entire business logic to a specific database (making the system dependent on 
Mithya). A good architect uses the **Repository Pattern** to separate the logic (Satya) from the database details (Mithya).

### The Junior Developer's Trap

A junior developer is obsessed with the "Pot" (React, Java 17, AWS Lambda). They identify
their worth with the tool: "I am a Python Developer."

### The Architect's Realization

The Architect realizes these are just names and forms.

- React is just State Management + DOM Rendering
- Kafka is just a Log
- AWS S3 is just a Hash Map over a Network

### The Growth Hack: Meditative Abstraction

Extending the Mithya and Satya separation practice, abstraction becomes a way of life.

To become an architect, stop looking at the "Pot" and look for the "Clay." Don't just learn implementation details
(syntax); learn the underlying abstraction.

We all know what `Absrtaction` is, and can put it in practice when writing code. However, the real art is to understand
the implementation/architecture as an abstraction leveraging generic design patterns, and engineering principles.

Once a Staff Engineer or an Architect has mastered this art, they open up to the opportunity of applying the same patterns
to a bigger scope. And hence, they bring more value to the system/organisation, and have a wider impact.

Look at it and ask: "If I remove the language-specific syntax, what remains?"

- Replace ArrayList with "Collection"
- Replace PostgreSQL with "Persistent Storage"
- Replace React Component with "UI View"

And once they are able to find patterns in a wider architecture, the impact of their solutions becomes multifold.

**Exercise**

When you learn a new tool, ask: "What is the Satya (core concept) here, and what is the Mithya (syntax/sugar)?"

### Saakshi Bhaava: The Witness Consciousness in Debugging

Saakshi Bhaava is the attitude of a witness—watching events without getting emotionally entangled. **Software Parallel: 
Detachment from Code**.

- **Ego-Identification**: Junior developers often feel, "I am my code." When a reviewer finds a bug, they feel personally 
attacked. This blocks growth.
- **The Witness**: An Architect views the system with Sakshi Bhava. 
  - **In Code Reviews**: "This code has a bug" is a factual observation, not a judgment of self-worth. 
  - **In Debugging**: When production is on fire, the Developer panics. The Architect enters "Witness Mode"—observing 
  the logs dispassionately to find the root cause without fear.
- **Implementation**: Practice "Egoless Programming." Treat your code as an external object that you are observing, not as 
an extension of yourself.

## Final Thoughts
I've realized that coding without architectural awareness isn't creation; it's just syntax arrangement waiting to 
become technical debt. It's time to stop identifying with the "Pot" (the tools) and start mastering the "Clay" (the patterns).

And then to have a wider impact, all bug fixes, improvements, e.t.c become tribe/domain wide improvement opportunities up
for grabs.

It seems like Advaita Vedanta Phylosophy has a lot to offer, not just for professional growth, but personal and spiritual
growth as well.
